# Mini-Bash-Shell
OPERATING SYSTEMS course project


Its a C program simulating Linux terminal behavior for running commands.

Usage:
 - Compile shellc file (gcc shell.c)

- run executable created(./a.out by default)

- now type commands and press enter to get output

- multiple commads can be run together which are semicollon separated. 

- exit command stops the shell (i.e ends the c-program)
